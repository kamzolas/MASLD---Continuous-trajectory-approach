# MASLD---Continuous-trajectory-approach
By moving beyond conventional stage-based MASLD classification, we uncover the sequence of critical molecular events that enhance our understanding of MASLD/MASH pathophysiology. This approach enabled the identification of novel trajectory-specific biomarkers, offering a more refined and personalised strategy for managing MASLD patients.
