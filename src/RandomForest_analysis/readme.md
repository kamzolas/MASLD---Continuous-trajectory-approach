Includes all Random Forest classification and regression analyses, applied to produce the biomarker sets described in the study. The training has been applied exclusively on the UCAM/VCU dataset. Additionally, we provide all the files that reproduce the analyses on the external validation transcriptomic datasets (EPoS, GUBRA, Fujiwara) as well as the validation on the plasma proteomic datasets.
